      Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes and computational machines.[1][2] As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.[3][4] Computer science addresses any computational problems, especially information processes, such as control, communication, perception, learning, and intelligence.[5][6][7]

Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics and computational geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithmics have been called the heart of computer science.[8] Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer programming involves the use of them to create complex systems. Computer architecture describes construction of computer components and computer-controlled equipment. Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be automated?".[9][5] Unlike other computing paradigms, computer scientists are focused on academic research.
